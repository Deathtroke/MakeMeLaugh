### Potential

Mouthing Off: "Audio is an important part of game design, but with so many DAWs and midi keyboards to choose from, it can be hard to choose! So we're going back to basics!
For this diversifier, every bit of audio in your game must be made with your mouth! Singing, beatboxing, and little lip smacks for impact are all allowed and encouraged!
You may still use software to trim the audio files as needed, but they should not be artificially created. Good Luck!"
